    "song":"Hey Charlie, I'm pregnant\nLiving on 9th Street\nRight above a dirty bookstore\nOff Euclid Avenue\nI stopped taking dope\nAnd I quit drinking whiskey\nAnd my old man plays the trombone\nAnd works out at the track\nHe says that he loves me\nEven though its not his baby\nHe says that he'll raise him up\nLike he would his own son\nAnd he gave me a ring\nThat was worn by his mother\nAnd he takes me out dancin'\nEvery Saturday night\nHey Charlie, I think about you\nEvery time I pass a fillin' station\nOn account of all the grease\nYou used to wear in your hair\nI still have that record\nOf Little Anthony and The Imperials\nBut someone stole my record player\nNow how do ya like that?\nHey Charlie, I almost went crazy\nAfter Mario got busted\nI went back to Omaha\nTo live with my folks\nBut everyone I used to know\nWas either dead or in prison\nSo I came back to Minneapolis\nThis time I think I'm gonna stay\nHey Charlie, I think I'm happy\nFor the first time since my accident\nI wish I had all the money\nWe used to spend on dope\nI'd buy me a used car lot\nAnd I wouldn't sell any of 'em\nI'd just drive a different car every day\nDependin' on how I feel\nHey Charlie, for chrissakes\nDo you want to know the truth of it?\nI don't have a husband\nHe don't play the trombone\nI need to borrow money\nTo pay this lawyer\nAnd Charlie, hey\nI'll be eligible for parole\nCome Valentine's Day"
